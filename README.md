# LocalMicro
This is a simple bat executable for Windows local development with microservices. 

### Why I created this?
A: I'm using WSL to develop many Laravel projects with multiple PHP version. Although Laragon is a good tool, but it only serve 1 php version at the same time. So, I switch to Valet Linux in WSL (not Valet Windows). This make me need to manually go to the `%SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` file to update the local domain for a project. Hence, this BAT file created.
